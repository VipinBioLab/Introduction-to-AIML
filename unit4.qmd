# Unit 4: The Landscape of AI and Data Science

 This unit is designed to immerse you in the fundamental concepts, historical evolution, and the wide-ranging impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS). We will explore what these fields entail, how they have developed over time, the core principles that underpin them, their transformative applications across various industries, and the diverse career opportunities they offer. By completing this unit, you will gain a comprehensive appreciation for the scope of AI and DS and understand their synergistic relationship. Our discussions will often refer to key texts such as "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by @russell2016artificial, "A First Course in Artificial Intelligence" by  @khemani2013first, and "Artificial Intelligence by Example" by  @rothman2018artificial for practical illustrations.
